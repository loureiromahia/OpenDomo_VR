Plan
----------

1. Not case sensative.
2. Tabs are fine, so are spaces --- DONE!!
3. Separate checking from file io, so that this can be used in the web
4. implement {} to mean "match agaist dictionary"
4a. unlike [] and <>, for optimization reasons, {} will be the first
match, not the longest match.
5. Make a DICT type, so (DICT program programs.dic) or something
5a. this will be the same as (WORD<{programs.dic}> program)
6. Make stuff in "" and '' auto escape ' and ""'
7. Allow the dictionary program to list all matches without restarting
8. (HARD LEVEL) allow the dictionary program to output matches and
rank them based on how good a match was it
9. Add a $USER$ variable and other env variables eg. $EMAIL$, $HOME$
10. Allow any variable to be set via the cmd line
    eg../dictionary "speech" dicfile.dic --vars="VAR=LA;VAR2=BBB"
11. maybe syntax errors better by giving a line number and a column
