Creating plugins is very easy to do.

Plugins consist of three files, a plugin.info file, an actions.dic file and an executable

The plugin.info will contain information about the plugin
An example plugin.info is:

	name = TotemPlugin							*Any spaces will be removed, Music Launcher will be installed as MusicLauncher
	version = 1.0								*This line must be either an interger (1, 6, 10) or a float (1.1, 2.4, 4.2)
	file = totem								*The name of the file that will be called
												*If your plugin doesn't need a file enter NONE
	description = Control Totem Media Player	*This is the description that will be displayed to the user before installation
	author = Brett Mayson						*The creator of the Plugin
	actions =									*Actions the plugin adds
	dependencies = totem						*This is an optional line. If added the user will be notified of any programs they need
	play video,plays the loaded video			*"play video" is what the user says, "plays the loaded video" is what the plugin will do 
	pause video,pauses the video if it is playing
	next video,plays the next video in the playlist
	previous video,plays the previous video in the playlist





The code for the actions will be stored in two files, an executable and a dictionary file.
The dictionary file contains what voice commands will be sent to your plugin.
	<p,P>lay <v,V>ideo			*When the user says "Play Video", '--play' will be sent to the execuatable named totem
	  totem '--play'
	<pause,POS> <v,V>ideo
	  totem '--pause'
	<n,N>ext <v,V>ideo
	  totem '--next'
	<p,P>revious <v,V>ideo
	  totem '--previous'



Files will be passed variables as normal, here is the totem contents:

	#!/bin/bash

	totem "$1"


It recieves '--play' as a variable if the user were to say "Play Video"
The executable file can be written in different languages. Python and Bash work well.




After this you should have three files:
	plugin.info
	actons.dic
	And the executable (In our example this would be toten)

You can now compress them into a .tar.gz file and rename the extension to .sp

Leaving us with something like totem.sp
You can see this plugin in the Example Plugins directory
